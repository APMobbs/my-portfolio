                            I would consider myself a very creative person, outside of work hour I'm usually working of 
                            my personal projects or just gaming, if you have any interest in any of the personal 
                            projects i've put some info on them below. 

                            While i'm working own stuff or playing games i usually have some to watch on in the background, 
                            some of the thing I watch are; Youtube, Anime, sci-fi or comic-book movies, Twitch and Episodic 
                            TV. I aslo spend time spending time with friends, mostly online but we do like to meet every 
                            once and awhile.

                            Outside of all that i also have a gym membership and try to go swimming for a hour at least
                            evert day but their time where this can't be done but when I can go it always makes me feel better.

                characters from other comic-book universe we are currently in the process of reworking the story with some new ideas in mind which i think will lead to a 
                better over all story, althougth none of the story is currently writen me and they team have much plan with extensive notes. Dispite my lack of wirting 
                i've submited a large amount of art which i've done for the story on my deviantart page, here is a link if your interested; https://www.deviantart.com/lieutenantaleka.

                for most of my life i've been a huge fan of Star Wars and i have used this to fuel many creative projects, i've been creating my own stormtrooper armor;
                buying the pieces, puting it together and painting them and i'm happy with what i've done with it so far. Also in the star wars setting my and my friends
                enjoy playing Star Wars Roleplaying Game made by Fantasy Flight Games it's in the same vain as DND but it a nice change of pace.
